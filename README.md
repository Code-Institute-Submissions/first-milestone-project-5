# THE MONKEES

## My first Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using everything that I have learnt so far from Code   Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3. (I may add a little bit of JS and JQuery)

My site is designed for a 1960's rock band who has been around for about 50years.
I have decided to follow the band's representatives requirement provided in brief
and I think it would be a good preview for when the band are ready to launch thier new website.

## UX

The UX for this project is quite simple, it's mainly a static site for fans to be able to
globally find the bands lastest and back catalog info. The navigation is easy and smooth for users.
Band's representatives only provided us with back catalog of tracks for now, but we will keep up to date with the 
lastest information on audio and video updates and so on. 
The colour shceme was requested by the band representatives.

Please note I have insisted for the contrast of the red to be different as I was advised it
will be more beneficial to have a lighter contrast for readability purposes.

## Features 

* All the images for this project have been provided by the band representatives.

* Homepage alert - JS alert used to show visitors/fans about upcoming updates and latest releases.

* Nav - Bootstrap hamburger menu used for mobile/tablet. Bootstrap used for quick production of modern CSS
and use of their predefinded classes.

* Mp3 files provided by band representatives was used for the music page. This is for ease of access to their songs
instead of been redirected to a new webpage, the user/fan can have capability of listening to a song 
direct on the bands website as well as downloading thier favourite songs.

* Videos section - All the videos used on this site are Youtube embeds. Youtube used for ease of access to
view the bands videos so the user/fan does not have to be redirected from the bands site to see their youtube videos.

* Social buttons - I have added the bands social follow buttons to the footer of every page, this is aimed
at hoping to increase their following by traffic coming from the website.
I went with the approach of in sight in mind, if the socials icons are visible all the time in the footeer
as the user gets to the bottom of each page I assumed htis could improve social following.

* Subscription form has been added to site via modal. To help user/fans connnect with the band via email updates.

* Gallery - Images optimized to reduce size to improve page laod speed. Font awesome Icons was used to improve the UX for the gallery when viewed by 
a fan/visitor.

* Contact form - CSS used to add abit of interactivity to the contact page.

* Wireframing was done with the band representatives present I just did some mock ups on paper of how the band wanted their site to generally look and feel. 

### Possible feature to implement 

* Subscription form could be improved as other tech could be used to gather a
mailing list for the band to be able to do regular new updates to their sites.

* More could be added to audio tracks and audio tracks could be listed as playlist and trigger changes automatically via JS.

* Contact form can be updated with JS by adding mail functions to it.
